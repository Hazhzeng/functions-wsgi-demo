# Pristine
A shared note taking website for casual user.

## Story
**Pristine** is one of my personal projects which aims to motivate myself to keep learning after my graduation.

Any easy way to lose passion is the inability of tracking what I have learnt. **Pristine** starts as a personal note taker which aims to serve myself on desktop and mobile.

Later on, I implement a simple account management and a minimal tag system, making it easier to categorise blogs and topics.

## Philosophy
I have a habit of writing diary, reminding me what happened yesterday or the same day last year.

A downside of diary recording is not able to **share your thought to others**. However, these days, most forums have insufficient promises for protecting personal privacy (e.g. marking who posts the comment, unable to remove comment record from the database).

I think we should have speaking equality while keeping ourselves safe.

Shall let our ideas flow, but not keeping an eye on who bores them.
